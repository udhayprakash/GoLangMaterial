Go Language Material

    Go
        - General Purpose Compiled Programing language
        - created by Ken Thompson (B, C, Unix, UTF-8), Rob Pike(Unix, UTF-8), 
          Robert Griesemer(Hotspot, JVM) and few google engineers.
        - first release was on March 2012.
        - No pre-requisites need. Can be learned as first programming language.
        - C language is the most direct influence on Go.
        - Platform-independent. 
            - Create executable build based on the platform. 
            - Means, source code is translated into language that the system understands.
        - comes with its own compiler
        - statically typed programming language
        - Concurrency 
            - allows multiple processes running simultaneously and effectively.
        - garbage collector - automatic memory management
        - Execution flow - top to botton and left to right order
        - Official website: https://www.golang.org
        - Go programs are two types
            - Executables
            - Libraries
                - Libraries are collections of code that we package together so that we can use them in other programs.
        - Go doesn't care about white-spaces and indentation
        - Two type of comments are supported:
            - line comment //
            - multi-line comment /* */
        - Functions are building blocks of a Go Program
        - All versions are backward compatible (promised).
        - Go has replaced the traditional features of class inheritance with the help of
        its two features, i.e., type embedding and interfaces. 
        - Other features
            - Fast compilation process
            - Default concurrency support
            - Simple and easy to use
        - Designed to achieve concurrency using the multi-core CPUs available these days
        - compiles, combining all dependency libraries and module into a single binary file based
          on OS type and architecture
        - Popular features of other languages, which are not present in Golang are
             - no implicit numeric conversions
             - no constructors or destructors
             - no operator overloading
             - no default parameter values
             - no inheritance
             - no generics
             - no exceptions
             - no macros
             - no function annotations
             - no thread-local storage
        -  It is meant to replace C++ and Java in terms of Google's needs. 
           Go was meant to alleviate some of the slowness and clumsiness of development 
           of very large software systems. 
        - To be a little more specific, Go helps solve ‚Ä¶
             - slow compilation and slow execution
             - programmers that collaborate using different subsets of languages
             - readability and documentation
             - language consistency
             - versioning issues
             - multi-language builds
             - dependencies being hard to maintain
        - Compilers
            - There are two Go compiler implementations, gc, and gccgo. 
                Gc uses a different calling convention and linker and because of this, 
                can only be linked with C programs following the same convention. 
                Gccgo is a GCC frontend that can be linked with GCC-compiled C or C++ programs. 
                Gccgo is slower to compile than the default gc, but supports more powerful 
                optimizations so many programs compiled with it will run faster. 
                This takes great care and even more patience.
            
            - The cgo program provides the mechanism for a foreign function interface to
                allow safe calling of C libraries from Go code. SWIG extends this capability 
                to C++ libraries.
        - Limitations of Go
            - No Generics, no .map, .reduce, .filter
            - No exceptions or assertions, as mentioned earlier (but I feel that this could go either way)
            - No Ternary operations. Use the good ole 'if else' statements.
            - Absolutely no tolerance for unused variables or imports (but is that really a bad thing?)
            - Your virus protection might think your compiled binaries are infected because it doesn't understand the structure of a Go Binary üòÖ
            - No pointer arithmetic (but thats for safety, and simplifies implementation of the garbage collector)
            - And honestly, dealing with GOPATH is kinda messy and annoying. You are forced to do all of your go projects within your GOPATH, but IDE's like VSCode and GoLand allow you to set the GoPath for your project without affecting your system's actual GOPATH.
        -Philosophy
            - Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating
              The number 1 feature of GoLang is the exact opposite definition of what OOP stands for.
            - Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)
                - Only one way of doing things
                    No more spaces vs tabs, functions vs objects, for vs while ‚Ä¶ 
                    Developers write the same code, compiler can optimize it better.
        - OOP
            - There are no classes in Go, but some features of Object Oriented programming are supported:
                - Encapsulation (possible on package level in Go)
                - Composition (possible through embedding in Go)
                - Polymorphism (possible through Interface satisfaction in Go)
                - Inheritance (Not possble - overloading makes code harder to debug)
                
    Go Tools
        - To check the go version, 
                go version
        - To know all the options, 
                go help
        - To get help about a package, 
                godoc fmt Println

    DataTypes
        - statically typed programming language
        - Data Types
            - Integers
                - unsigned - uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
                - signed - int8, int16, int32, int64
                - aliases: 
                    - rune is alias for int32
                    - byte is alias for uint8
                        1 byte = 8 bits
                        1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte
                        1024 kilobytes = 1 Megabyte ...
                - Also, there are three machine dependent integer types
                    - Machine dependent because their size depends on type of system architecture.
                    - uint, int, uintptr
                - Generally, we can use int

            - Floating-point numbers
                - float32 - referred, also, as single precision
                - float64 - referred, also, as double precision
                - Larger sized floating-point number increases its precision
                - Generally, we can use float
            - NaN (not a number)
                - To represent 0/0
            - +‚àû and ‚àí‚àû (positive and negative infinity)
            - Complex 
                - complex64
                - complex128

            - Strings
                - Go Strings are made up of individual bytes, usually one for each character
                - non-english characters are represented by more than 1 byte
                - created using 
                    - double quotes("Hello world")
                        - single-line strings
                        - Allow special sequences
                    - back ticks (`Hello world`)
            - bool (true, false)

    Identifier Naming Convention
        - first character - A-Z, a-z
        - remaining chars - A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _
        - pascalCase or CamelCase is recommended.
