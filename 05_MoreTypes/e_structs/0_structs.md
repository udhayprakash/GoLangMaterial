Structs
=======

    - User-defined type that contains a collection of named fields/properties.
    - so, struct type variables are also called "named-types".
    - used to group related data together to form a single unit.
    - structs are as a lightweight class that supports composition but not inheritance.
    - Any struct type that starts with a capital letter is exported and accessible 
      from outside packages. Similarly, any struct field that starts with a capital 
      letter is exported.
    - On the contrary, all the names starting with a small letter are visible only 
      inside the same package.
