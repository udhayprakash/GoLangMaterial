Go Data Types
=============
    1. Basic Types
        a) Numbers
            i) int
                1. signed  : int8, int16, int32, int64
                    - rune is synonym for int32
                2. unsigned: uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
                    - byte is synonym for uint8
                    - uintptr
                        - its width is both specified,
                           but is sufficient to hold all the bits of a pointer value
                        - Used, mainly, in low level programming
                3. general : int and uint - both either 32 or 64 bits
            ii) float(IEEE 754 standard implemented by all modern CPUs)
                - float32
                    - 6 decimal digits precision
                    - math.MaxFloat32 = 3.4e38
                    - math.MinFloat32 = 1.4e-45
                - float64 (recommended)
                    - 15 decimal digits precision
                    - math.MaxFloat64 = 1.8e308
                    - math.MinFloat64 = 4.9e-324
            iii) complex numbers
        b) Strings
            - Strings
            - rune
        c) Booleans
            - true, false
    2. Aggregate Types
        - Values are concatenation of other values in memory
        - Fixed Size
        a) Arrays
            - Homogeneous - all elements are of same type
        b) Structs
            - Heterogeneous - elements may be of different type
    3. Reference Types
        a) Pointers
        b) Slices
        c) Maps
        d) Functions
        e) Channels
    4. Interface Types

Comparable Types: booleans, numbers, Strings

bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128

NOTE:
=====
The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems
and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. When you need an integer value you should
use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.
