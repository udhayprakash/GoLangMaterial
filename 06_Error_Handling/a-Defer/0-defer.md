# Defer

    - A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.
    - The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.
    - Deferred functions are run even if a runtime panic occurs.

    - Goâ€™s garbage collector recycles unused memory, but do not assume it will release unused operating system resources like open files and network connections.
    - They should be closed explicitly.
	- Deferred function calls are executed in Last In First Out order after the surrounding function returns. 
	- Deferred functions may read and assign to returning function's named return values.
